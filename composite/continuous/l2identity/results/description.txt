-----------------------------------

Quality of reconstruction:
	- 1.x and 2.x are still good reconstrucitn, 3.x do not work
	- 1.3 starts to mess up, not as good as the other ones but still pretty decent
	- even 2.3 is fairly well recovered (the background is quite nice is this scenario)
	- 3.1 is not recovering good, two explanations:
		- the backgroudn si quite nasty
		- the set of parameters is not properly adapted
			-> I could try lambda2 lower and lambda1 higher
	- 3.2 works actually better
	- 3.3 suffers from the same limitations as 3.2, may be improved with a change of parameters
	
	- Overall, in many cases some medium to low intensity peaks are sometimes discarded.
	- The location of the recovered peak is often excellent, even when peaks are very close to each other.
	- The intensity of the recovered peaks may be wrong, sometimes by a lot. Sometimes, high intensityu peaks become less intense than medium intensity ones.
	- For a fix lambda1, varying lambda2 can be helpful to identify the number of peaks to recover as well as their exact location.
	
	- LASSO is consistently outperformed by composite problems.
